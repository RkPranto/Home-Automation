# Home-Automation
This project is about  voice controlled lights and fan. I used Google Speech API to convert my speech to text. Then I generated a identical character for certain action which I sent to Arduino from my android phone using Bluetooth. Arduino was doing rest of the work with the help of loaded program.


1. First install the app on your android phone
2. If you wanna make change on the app, download "voice_controller.aia" . Import to MIT App Inventer 2 and make change whatever you want.
3. Read "final_peripheral_code.ino". Make your Arduino connection according to the code.
4. Open your android app. Connect bluetooth. Done.
5. Now you can do command using button on your app or click on voice recorder picture and record your command like "light on", "light off".
